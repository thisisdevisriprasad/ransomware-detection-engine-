Developing the hybrid model using datasets having similar features as model is relying on and test the performance. To make hybrid model either using percentage rule (ex.65% supervised +35% unsupervised) or threshold based (accuracy &lt; 85% use unsupervised). The hybrid model as mention should be ensemble of supervised and unsupervised.
